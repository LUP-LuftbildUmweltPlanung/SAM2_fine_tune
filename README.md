# SAM2_fine_tune
The Segment Anything Model 2 ([SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2?tab=readme-ov-file#download-checkpoints)) is an advanced foundational model designed to tackle prompt-based visual segmentation in both images and videos. 
The model leverages a simple transformer architecture enhanced with streaming memory for optimized processing. SAM 2, trained on a customized dataset, achieves robust performance through targeted fine-tuning techniques.

## Description

The key distinction between fine-tuning a model and training one from scratch lies in the initial state of the weights and biases. When training from scratch, these parameters are randomly initialized based on a specific strategy, meaning the model starts with no prior knowledge of the task and performs poorly initially. Fine-tuning, however, begins with pre-existing weights and biases, allowing the model to adapt more effectively to the custom dataset.

The dataset used for fine-tuning SAM 2 consisted of 8-bit RGB images with 50 cm resolution for binary segmentation tasks.
The checkpoints which defined here in the pipeline is `sam2_hiera_large.pt`.
